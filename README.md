### Hotkeys
- press `shift` to toggle color inversion
- press `t` to switch to the fla(t) brush
- press `d` to switch to (d)ots
- press `c` to switch to (c)ircles
- press `f` to switch to the (f)an
- press `r` to clea(r) the canvas

### Tips
- On devices that repeat held inputs, hold `shift` to rapidly swap inversion. This creates a 'flannel' sort of effect on circles :)
